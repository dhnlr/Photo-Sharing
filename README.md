# Photo-Sharing
:camera: Social app for sharing photo, hopefully simple instagram clone :camera:

Users who have an account can publish their photo, another user can follow other users to see their photo. Only follower can interact with user, comment and see photo.

## What's in the box?

* Authenticate and authorization
* CRUD for photo with caption
* 20 filter effect
* CRUD for comment
* Follow; without pending follow, unfollow, or block (We care about your real life relationship)
> You can implement unfollow in your client, there's an API to do that. I just don't want it

## What's the roadmap?

- [x] ~~Nothing~~

## How to run?

#### Server
```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

#### Client
```
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
```

## I want try this

You can try this at [Photo](http://photo.dhnlr.com)

Demo account
```
1.
username : coba
password : coba

2.
username : follow
password : follow
```
`Follow` already followed `coba`. Only `coba` has photo in its account. You can see feed example on `Follow` account.

*Ps. I don't make sure that link always runs and please don't abuse database or CPU usage*
